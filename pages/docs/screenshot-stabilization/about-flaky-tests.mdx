# About flaky tests

Definition and stabilization strategies.

### What are flaky tests

Visual flaky tests are screenshots that display random variations. They are annoying because they invalidate GitHub status check and neutralize visual testing's first purpose: easily spot visual changes.

Some flaky test use-cases are well known and easy to fix, like date stabilization. But, on the other hand, some of them need excellent engineering skills.

This section will provide the tools to fix the most common ones.

**NB.** We do not provide the "mark test as a flaky" button that ignores visual diff because we think missing a false negative result is more damaging than removing the test.
