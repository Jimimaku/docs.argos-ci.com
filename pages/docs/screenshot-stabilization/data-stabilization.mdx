# Data Stabilization

Stabilize refreshed date and generated seeds to avoid flaky tests.

## Stabilize data seeds

Generated data seeds from tools like [Chance](https://chancejs.com/) or [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) can cause flaky tests. Happily each of this tools provide the ability to use your own data.

We advice to continue using your favorite data seed generator and set fixed variables only when flaky are created.

## Stabilize date and time

When a displayed date is not a main purpose of a the test, it can be convenient to freeze it to a fixed value.

The easier way is to use you test framework feature like bellow :

```js
/* Cypress command to freeze date to 20 May 2030 */
const now = new Date(2030, 4, 20)
cy.clock(now)
```

In an other way, you can use [MockDate](https://github.com/boblauer/MockDate) library to mock the current date.

## Hide rebellious components

If none of this methods work, you can hide node DOM from screenshot with [style injection](/docs/screenshots-stabilization/style-injection).
