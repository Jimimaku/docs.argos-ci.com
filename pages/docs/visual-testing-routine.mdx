# Visual testing routine

Add visual testing to the developer's code routine.

## Objectives

With a one-line code, you can take a picture of an end-to-end test step, review the screenshot, and keep it safe from future visual regression.

Argos CI has two main purposes prevent visual regression across website codebase and ensure UI stability for every browser and resolution.

More than that, Argos CI give developers the confidence to ship feature safely with automatic detection and manual review.

## The safe visual routine

### Visual changes, automatic detection

**Argos CI** receives screenshots from the Continuous Integration environment when a commit is pushed to GitHub. The Github check status turns red when visual diffs are detected by Argos CI, and a link is displayed to review the visual changes on Argos app.

Click on `Details` button to review all visual changes in Argos CI app.

<GithubMergeStatus status="error" maxWidth="500px" mb="40px" />

### Screenshot comparison

**Argos app** is a web platform designed to review screenshots and verify that they match expected results.

The side-by-side UI allows developers to compare new commit's screenshots with their `main` branch's counterparts, easily spot visual changes and prevent visual regressions.

#### Review approval

Click on `Mark as approved` button to approve the changes and validate the Github status.

<ArgosInBrowser approved={false} maxWidth="600px" />

#### Review rejection

If new commits screenshots don't satisfy your expectations, rework your code and push a new commit.
