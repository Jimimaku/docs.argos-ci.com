# Visual testing routine

Add visual testing routine to developers code's routine.

Visit [about Argos](/docs/about-argos) to get insights about visual testing advantages.

Argos CI detects visual changes on every commits and notify you via Github check status.

Click on `Details` button to review all visual changes into Argos CI app.

<GithubMergeStatus status="error" maxWidth="500px" mb="40px" />

Your new commit's screenshots are compared side-by-side with their `main` branch's counterparts to easily spot visual updates and prevent regressions.

<ArgosInBrowser approved={false} maxWidth="600px" />

Click on `Mark as approved` button to approve the changes and valid the Github status.

If new commits screenshots doesn't match expected results rework on your code and push a new commit.
