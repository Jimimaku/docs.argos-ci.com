# Getting started

Learn how to install Argos CI and start visual testing.

Welcome to the Argos CI documentation !

Go to [about Argos CI](/docs/about-argos-ci) to read about visual testing, Argos CI philosophy or who we are.

### System Requirements

- Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Having [end-to-end tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/static-vs-unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests) and a [CI environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)

## Install Argos CI

### Add Argos to your stack

Use the integration that matches your testing stack :

- [Cypress](/docs/integrations/cypress)
- [Puppeteer](/docs/integrations/puppeteer)
- Or use [custom integration](/docs/integrations/custom-integration)

### Update your CI workflow

- [CircleCI](/docs/ci-config/circle-ci)
- [GitHub Actions](/docs/ci-config/github-actions)
- Or use [Others CI](/docs/ci-config/others-ci) doc

### Add screenshots review to your coding routine

Argos CI detects visual changes on every commits and notify you via Github check status.

Click on `Details` button to review all visual changes into Argos CI app.

<GithubMergeStatus status="error" mb="40px" maxWidth="500px" />

Your new commit's screenshots are compared side-by-side with their `main` branch counterparts to easily spot and prevent visual regressions.

<ArgosInBrowser approved={false} mb="40px" maxWidth="600px" />

Click on `Mark as approved` button to approve the changes and clear the Github check status.

If the screenshots is not satisfactory fix your code and push a new commit.
