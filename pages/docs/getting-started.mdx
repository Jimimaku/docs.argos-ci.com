# Getting started

Welcome to the Argos CI documentation!

To learn about Argos' philosophy, visit [about Argos CI](/docs/about-argos-ci).

**Prerequisites**: to use Argos CI, you need a GitHub-hosted project with [end-to-end tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/static-vs-unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests) and a [CI environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration).

### Get Argos app on GitHub marketplace.

Go to GitHub marketplace, install the [Argos-ci App](https://github.com/apps/argos-ci), and select organization and repository.

### Setup `ARGOS_TOKEN` as a GitHub Secret

- Login to https://www.argos-ci.com
- Click on your username to display your repositories
- Click on the one you want to activate
- Click on `Activate repository` and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN` value.
- Create a [GitHub Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named `ARGOS_TOKEN` with the copied value.

### Configure your CI to send screenshots to Argos

Use the CI configuration doc that matches your stack.

### Enjoy!

You are ready to use your favorite end-to-end framework
( ex. [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot),
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/screenshots),
[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page.screenshot),
[TestCafe](https://testcafe.io/documentation/402675/reference/test-api/testcontroller/takescreenshot) )
to take screenshots
and [add visual testing to your routine](/docs/visual-testing-routine/).
