# Get started with Argos

Argos is a visual testing app that adds screenshots review to a developer's routine and ships features with confidence.

To learn more about Argos' philosophy, visit [about Argos CI](/about-argos-ci).

**Prerequisites**: to use Argos CI, you need a GitHub-hosted project with [end-to-end tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/static-vs-unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests) and a [CI environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration).

### 1. Install the CLI

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev argos-cli
```

### 2. Subscribe Argos Free plan for GitHub Marketplace

[Subscribe Argos Free plan](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci/) from GitHub Marketplace.

You will be prompt to give access to your repository, don't worry we don't read code. We only use commits to match the correct "base screenshot".

At the end of the installation you will be redirected on the home of Argos.

### 3. Get the Argos repository's token

Argos assigns a unique token to the connected repositories. It ensures nobody except you can upload screenshots on your repository.

- Select the repository you want to activate and click on `Activate repository` button
- Copy and save the `ARGOS_TOKEN` value. It will be used as a environment variable during the CI configuration.

### 4. Configure your CI to send screenshots to Argos

- Setup `ARGOS_TOKEN` environment variable on your CI
- Run `argos upload screenshots-folder`

### Enjoy!
