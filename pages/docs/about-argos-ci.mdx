# About Argos CI

Argos CI is a visual testing app that adds screenshots review to a developer's routine and ships features with confidence.

### The birth of Argos CI

We create Argos CI with two primary purposes: to prevent visual regressions across a big website codebase and to ensure UI stability on all browsers and resolutions.

We implemented Argos as a devX tool for our frontend team. It has rapidly become a must-have app for every developer because preventing visual regression is an issue for everyone.

We use Argos CI in all big projects we work on and note the satisfaction of developers using it. With more than 10 000 000 million screenshots/month, we have gained the confidence to sell our product.
