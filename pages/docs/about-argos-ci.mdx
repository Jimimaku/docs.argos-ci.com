# About Argos CI

Argos CI is a visual testing app that add screenshots review to developer's routine in order to ship features with confidence.

### The birth of Argos CI

Argos CI was created with two main purposes : prevent visual regression across a big website codebase and insure UI stability in every browsers and resolutions.

We implemented Argos as a devX tool for our frontend team but it rapidly become a must have app for every developers because prevent visual regression is an issue for everyone.

We use Argos CI in all big projects we work in and note the satisfaction of every developers that use it. Currently, with more than 10 000 000 millions screenshot / month we gain the confidence to sell our product.

## How it works

**Argos CI** receives screenshots from Continuous Integration environment when a commit is pushed to GitHub. The Argos check turn red when visuals diffs are detected and a link is displayed to review the visuals changes on Argos app.

**Argos app** allows developers to review application's screenshots and verify that they matches expected results. Its designed to compare new commit's screenshots with their `main`'s counterparts, easily spot visuals changes and prevent visual regressions.

With a one-line code, you can screenshot a step of an end-to-end test, review the screenshot and keep it safe from future visual regression.
