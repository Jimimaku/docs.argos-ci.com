# Data Stabilization

Stabilize refreshed date and generated seeds to avoid flaky tests.

## Stabilize data seeds

Generated data seeds from tools like [Chance](https://chancejs.com/) or [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) can cause flaky tests. Happily each of this tools provide the ability to use your own data.

We advice to continue using your favorite data seed generator and set fixed variables only when flaky are created.

## Stabilize date and time

Multiple strategies can be used to avoid flaky tests causes by dates.

### Use a fixed date

When a date value is not a main purpose of a the test, it can be convenient to set it to a fixed date. For example, a date filter with default today value fix with this strategy.

### Use a library to mock the current date

[MockDate](https://github.com/boblauer/MockDate) is a javascript lib that change the "now" date.

### Use your test framework feature

In Cypress, you can freezing date with the following command :

```js
const now = new Date(2030, 5, 5)
cy.clock(now) // set current date to 5 Mai 2030
```

## Hide rebellious data

If none of this methods work, you have the ability to hide a DOM node from screenshot via [style injection](/docs/flaky-tests/style-injection) feature and custom class feature.
