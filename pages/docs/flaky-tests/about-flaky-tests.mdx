# About flaky tests

Definition and stabilization strategies.

### What are flaky tests

Visual flaky tests are screenshots that display randomly variations. They are pretty annoying because they invalid Argos status check and neutralize visual testing first purpose : easily spot visuals changes.

Some flaky use-cases are well known and easy to fix like date stabilization. On the other hand, some of them need real engineering skills to be fixed.

In this sections, we will provide some tools to fix the most common ones.

### Mark test as flaky

We decide to not provide the "mark test as flaky" button whom ignore visual diff. We think that ignore a test result is more damaging than removing the test.

## Usual flaky causes and defuse strategies

In this sections we will list most commons flaky test cases and fixing methods.
