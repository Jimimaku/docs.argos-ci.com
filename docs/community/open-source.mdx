# Open Source

Argos is open-source and community-driven, supported by a network of early advocates, contributors, and champions.

## Join the Community

The best way to contact us is to join the Argos [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WjzGrQGS4A). This is a great place to meet other users, ask questions, and share your work.

We welcome feature requests and will consider them as part of our roadmap.
