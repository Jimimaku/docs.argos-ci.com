# Contact us

Argos is open-source and community-driven, supported by a network of early advocates, contributors, and champions. We welcome feature requests and will consider them as part of our roadmap.

The best way to contact us is to join the [Argos Discord Server](https://argos-ci.com/discord).<br/>
This is a great place to hear news about Argos, ask questions, and suggest new features.

We are also available by email at [contact@argos-ci.com](mailto:contact@argos-ci.com).
