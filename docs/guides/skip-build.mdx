# Skipping a Build

In some cases, you may want to skip Argos checks for a commit or pull request.  
This is especially useful when Argos is configured as a **required status check** in GitHub, but screenshots are not needed (e.g. documentation-only changes, emergency hotfixes). Running Argos in these situations would be unnecessary and could even block your workflow.

To address this, you can use the `skipped` option.  
When `skipped: true` is set, **no screenshots are uploaded** and the commit status is immediately marked as **success**.

## When to use `skipped`

- Documentation changes with no impact on the UI
- Hotfixes where visual testing is not relevant
- Branches or pull requests that donâ€™t require screenshots
- Scheduled builds you want to disable selectively

:::warning

Skipping should only be used in exceptional cases. It is not meant to replace regular visual testing.

## How to enable skipping

You can enable skipping in two ways:

1. **Environment variable**  
   Set `ARGOS_SKIPPED` to `"true"` in your CI configuration.

2. **Configuration option**  
   Add `skipped: true` in your Argos SDK configuration.

## GitHub Actions example

```yaml title="ci.yml"
jobs:
  visual-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run visual-tests # or your test command
        env:
          ARGOS_SKIPPED: "true" # Marks Argos check as "success" without uploading screenshots
```
