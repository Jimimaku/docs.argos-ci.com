# Account Management

When you sign up for Argos, you create an account that manages your projects and subscriptions.  
Argos offers three types of plans:

- [Hobby](/pricing-plans#hobby-plan)
- [Pro](/pricing-plans#pro-plan)
- [Enterprise](/pricing-plans#enterprise-plan)

Each plan provides different features and resources to match your needs.

You can sign up with **Google**, **GitHub**, or **GitLab**.

## Signing up with a Git provider

Argos supports the following Git providers:

- [GitHub](/github)
- [GitLab](/gitlab)

When you sign up, you’ll be asked to authorize Argos to access your Git provider.  
This connection becomes your default login method.

After signing up, you can manage login methods in your **Personal Settings**.

### Choosing a connection when creating a project

When you create your first project, you’ll be asked to connect a Git provider.
