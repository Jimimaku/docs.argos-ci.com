# Account Management

When you first sign up for Argos, you'll create an account. This account is used to manage your Argos projects. Argos has three types of plans:

- [Hobby](pricing-plans#hobby-plan)
- [Pro](/pricing-plans#pro-plan)
- [Enterprise](/pricing-plans#enterprise-plan)

Each plan offers different features and resources, allowing you to choose the right plan for your needs.

When signing up for Argos, you can choose to sign up with Google, GitHub or GitLab.

## Sign up with a Git provider

You can sign up with any of the following supported Git providers:

- [GitHub](/github)
- [GitLab](/gitlab)

Authorize Argos to access your Git provider account. This will be the default login connection on your account.

Once signed up you can manage your login connections in your personal settings.

### Logging in with SAML Single Sign-On

SAML Single Sign-On enables you to log into your Argos Enterprise team with your organization's identity provider which manages your credentials.

Available only to Enterprise teams, this option can be configured by your team's administrator. To sign up for an Enterprise plan, [contact sales](/contact-us).

### Choosing a connection when creating a project
