# Parallel Testing

Boost test suite efficiency with Argos Parallel Testing: Automate and streamline concurrent test executions across multiple environments effortlessly.

## Playwright

Argos seamlessly integrates with Playwright, offering out-of-the-box support for [Playwright tests sharding](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding). This means zero configuration hassle for you. For more details, refer to the [Argos Playwright SDK](/playwright).

## Other SDKs

For environments beyond Playwright, Argos facilitates sharding through two key environment variables, simplifying the setup:

- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL`: Specifies the number of parallel nodes. It's crucial to ensure equal calls to Argos upload across these nodes.
- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE`: A unique identifier for each build. In most CI environments, Argos will automatically generate this for you.

> **Note:** Alternatively, use `--parallel-nonce` and `--parallel-total` flags with the CLI or `parallel: { nonce: string, total: number }` within SDK options.

### Implementing in GitHub Actions

Below is a practical example showcasing how to configure Argos sharding within a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
- name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
  continue-on-error: true
  env:
    ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL: ${{ strategy['job-total'] }}
    # ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE is automatically detected

  run: npm exec argos upload --parallel ./screenshots
```
