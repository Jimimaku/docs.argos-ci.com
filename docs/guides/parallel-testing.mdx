# Parallel Testing

Parallel Testing, synonymous with Sharding, significantly boosts the efficiency of your test suite by enabling concurrent execution of tests. Argos elevates this capability by providing seamless, automated configuration processes.

## Playwright

Argos seamlessly integrates with Playwright, offering out-of-the-box support for [Playwright tests sharding](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding). This means zero configuration hassle for you. For more details, refer to the [Argos Playwright SDK](/playwright).

## Other SDKs

For environments beyond Playwright, Argos facilitates sharding through two key environment variables, simplifying the setup:

- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL`: Specifies the number of parallel nodes. It's crucial to ensure equal calls to Argos upload across these nodes.
- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE`: A unique identifier for each build. In most CI environments, Argos will automatically generate this for you.

> **Note:** Alternatively, use `--parallel-nonce` and `--parallel-total` flags with the CLI or `parallel: { nonce: string, total: number }` within SDK options.

### Implementing in GitHub Actions

Below is a practical example showcasing how to configure Argos sharding within a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
- name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
  continue-on-error: true
  env:
    ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL: ${{ strategy['job-total'] }}
    # ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE is automatically detected

  run: npm exec argos upload --parallel ./screenshots
```
