# Adding Screenshot Metadata

Enrich your screenshots in Argos with metadata by adding a companion JSON file. This metadata appears on the build page and helps contextualize how and why a screenshot was generated.

## How It Works

For each screenshot file, you can create a metadata file with the same name and the `.argos.json` suffix:

```
myscreenshot.png
myscreenshot.png.argos.json
```

The `.argos.json` file must be valid JSON following the Argos metadata schema.

## Schema Autocomplete

To enable autocompletion, type checking, and schema validation in editors like VS Code, you can add a `$schema` field at the top of your `.argos.json` file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://api.argos-ci.com/v2/screenshot-metadata.json"
}
```
