# Install Argos with Cypress

Setup Argos with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

The best way to integrate Argos with Cypress is to use [@argos-ci/cypress](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos-cypress).

It automatically stabilizes your screenshots avoiding screenshoting during "loading" phase of your application.

## 1. Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cypress
```

## 2. Setup in Cypress

Make sure that you have [setup Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) and add this line to your `cypress/support/commands.js` file.

```js
import "@argos-ci/cypress/support";
```

## 3. Use in your tests

```js
it("...", () => {
  // Screenshot a page
  cy.argosScreenshot("home");

  // Screenshot a component
  cy.get("main div.breadcrumb").argosScreenshot("home-breadcrumb");
});
```
