# Argos Command Line Interface

`@argos-ci/cli` allows you to manually upload screenshots to [argos-ci.com](https://app.argos-ci.com). It can be used to set up a custom CI.

The CLI is available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@argos-ci/cli) and open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos-javascript/tree/main/packages/cli).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cli
```

## Configuration

To use `@argos-ci/cli` you have to configure your repository token in an environment variable:

```sh
ARGOS_TOKEN=<your-repository-token>
```

It is also possible to use `--token` argument in the CLI but it is not recommended.

## Usage

To upload screenshots stored in a `screenshots` folder, use `argos upload` command:

```sh
argos upload screenshots
```

## Advanced usage

### Run multiple Argos builds on the same commit

Assign a name to the Argos build with `--build-name` argument to run multiple builds for the same commit.

In this example we create one build for components and another for E2E:

```sh
argos upload --build-name components screenshots/components
argos upload --build-name e2e screenshots/e2e
```

### Parallel test suites

Parallelism is a common way to speed up test suites by running multiple tests concurrently and then combining results at the end.

To configure parallel test suites using `@argos-ci/cli`, you have to setup two environment variables:

- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE`: a unique build ID for this parallel build. Argos groups uploaded screenshots using this ID.
- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL`: the number of parallel nodes being ran. `argos upload` command must be called exactly up to this number.

It is also possible to configure parallel mode using arguments: `--parallel-nonce` and `--parallel-total`.

Once configured, upload commands can be ran multiple times and will aggregate screenshots in the same build.

```sh
argos upload --parallel screenshots
```
