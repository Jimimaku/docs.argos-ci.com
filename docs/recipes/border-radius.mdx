# Stabilizing border radius

Sometimes, the `border-radius` property can cause screenshots to appear differently across different browsers or devices.

To address this, you can add the `data-test-no-radius` attribute to unstable components and inject the following CSS snippet before taking a screenshot:

```css
[data-test-no-radius] {
  border-radius: 0 !important;
}
```

For more information on how to inject styles into a page, see the [Code Injection](/code-injection#inject-styles-in-a-page) documentation.
