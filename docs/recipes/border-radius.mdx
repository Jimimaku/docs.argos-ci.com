# Border radius

A usual use case of flaky screenshots comes from the unstable `border-radius` rendered by browsers.

We recommend adding the `data-test-no-radius` attribute to instable components and injecting the following CSS before taking a screenshot.

```css
[data-test-no-radius] {
  border-radius: 0 !important;
}
```

Read the [code injection doc](/code-injection#inject-styles-in-a-page) to know how to inject style into the tested page.
