# How to subscribe

To use Argos team features, a paid plan subscription is required. You can either upgrade an existing team or create a new team.

## Steps to Subscribe

**Note:** A 14-day trial is available for the first team upgrade.

1. If you do not have a team yet, [create a new team](https://app.argos-ci.com/teams/new). Otherwise, go to the settings of your existing team.

2. In the Plan section, click on the `Upgrade` button.

<img
  src={upgradeButton}
  alt="upgrade button"
  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20, width: 600 }}
/>

3. Choose the team you wish to upgrade.

<img
  src={teamSelect}
  alt="team select"
  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20, width: 600 }}
/>

4. You will be redirected to Stripe Checkout. Complete the payment form.

5. After the payment process is successfully completed, you will receive a confirmation email.

**Note:** The payment will be processed at the end of the first month based on your usage.

## Subscription via GitHub Marketplace

If you prefer subscribing via GitHub Marketplace, initiate the subscription on the [Argos Marketplace page](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci). Ensure that you upgrade the correct organization on the Marketplace.
