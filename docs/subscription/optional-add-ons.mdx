# Optional Add-ons

2. Click "Enable and Pay" under the "GitHub Single Sign-On" section.
3. Select your team, authorize Argos on GitHub, and the feature will be activated.

## Availability and Payment

The cost of this add-on is $50 / month and it's exclusive to Stripe subscribers.

When you enable GitHub SSO, your team will be charged for the feature on your monthly billing. You will see "Add-on: GitHub SSO" line on your invoice. This feature can be disabled at any time.
