# Getting Started

Argos is a visual testing app that adds screenshots review to a developer's routine and ships features with confidence.

To learn more about Argos' philosophy, read the [introduction section](/).

**Prerequisites :** to use Argos CI, you need a GitHub-hosted project with [end-to-end tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/static-vs-unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests) and a [CI environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration).

### Get the Argos repository's token

Argos assigns a unique token to each repository to ensure that only allowed users can upload screenshots.

- Subscribe to [Argos Free plan](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) on GitHub Marketplace
- Follow the Github installation tunnel until you land on [Argos App](https://app.argos-ci.com/)
- Click on the repository you want to activate and click on `Activate repository` button
- Copy and save the `ARGOS_TOKEN` value

### Configure your CI to send screenshots to Argos

- Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable in your CI application
- Add this command to you CI workflow : `npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots`

> `npx` automatically installs `@argos-ci/cli`, but you can also add `@argos-ci/cli` and use `npx argos upload ./screenshots` command instead. It gives you more control on your dependencies.

### Enjoy!
