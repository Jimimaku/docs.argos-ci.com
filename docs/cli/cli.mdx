# Argos Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Argos Command Line Interface (CLI) offers a swift and straightforward method for uploading screenshots to the Argos visual testing platform. Ideally, this should be executed by your Continuous Integration (CI) process.

You can access `@argos-ci/cli` through our [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@argos-ci/cli). The source code is available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos-javascript/tree/main/packages/cli).

## Installation

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

## Configuration

Your configuration requirements may vary [depending on the CI you use](/upload-screenshots#configure-your-ci). Typically, you'll need to set ARGOS_TOKEN as a secret in the settings.

1. Log into [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your project settings, and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. Declare an environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` with the copied value.

Note: You can also specify the token with the `--token=<your-repository-token>` argument. However, for security reasons, we recommend using an environment variable instead.

## Upload Command

Use the `upload` command to upload screenshots stored in your <Tag>./screenshots</Tag> directory.

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

## Help Command

To view a list of available options, use the argos help command.

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli help upload" />
