# Introduction

Argos is a visual testing devX app that monitor visual changes on pull requests and notify the developer on GitHub. The developer reviews the changes on Argos to avoid visual regression and ship features with confidence.

You can appreciate Argos look-and-feel on the [demo build](https://app.argos-ci.com/lemonde/sirius/builds/15639/new).

### Universal

Take screenshots of full pages or individual components. No matter the language, browser or resolution, Argos detects screenshots updates to ensure your pull request is regression free.

### Fits in developer workflow

Be notified directly in GitHub via a pull-request "check status" when visual changes are detected. Use the direct link to review the changes on Argos.

### Allows visual review

Review Argos build to verify that new screenshots matches the expected results and compare updated screenshots with their baseline's counterpart. Approve the build changes to update de Github check status.

### Powered by Continuous Integration (CI)

The screenshots are taken when end-to-end tests are performed on the CI. This workflow protects your application from visual regression on each pull request.

## The birth of Argos

We created Argos as a devX tool for our frontend team with two main purposes: prevent visual regressions across a big website codebase and ensure UI stability on all browsers and resolutions.

It rapidly spread outside our team border and become a must-have app for every developers in our company as preventing visual regression is an issue for everyone.

Since, we have installed Argos in every project we have worked on and the developers teams immediately adopt it for the confidence it ensure. In 2022, with more than 10 000 000 million screenshots diff performed each month, we decided to level up and transform our internal tool into a commercial product.
