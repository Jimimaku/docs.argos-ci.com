# Introduction

Argos is a powerful visual testing tool that allows developers to easily compare screenshots and detect visual changes in their web applications.

## What is Argos?

With Argos, you can be notified of visual changes in real-time, directly within GitHub. The process is simple:

1. **Take screenshots** — Take screenshots of your application in various browsers and screen sizes.
2. **Compare screenshots** — Argos will automatically compare the screenshots with a reference set, and notify you of any visual changes.
3. **Review changes** — Review the visual changes in the Argos application, and either approve or reject the changes.
