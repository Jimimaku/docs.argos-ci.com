## Avoid visual bugs

Argos is a visual testing tool that allows developers to review visual changes introduced by each pull request. With Argos, you can avoid visual bugs and ensure that your application maintains a high level of visual quality.

## Easy to install

Argos provides integrations for popular CI and testing frameworks, making it easy to get started with visual testing in your existing projects. Simply follow the provided installation instructions, and you'll be up and running in no time. In addition, we have a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/WjzGrQGS4A) where you can get help if needed.

## Enjoyable to use

Once installed, Argos is straightforward to use. You can add the screenshot taking command anywhere in your E2E tests to cover a page against regression. Then, you can easily review the visual changes in [Argos' beautiful UI](https://app.argos-ci.com/argos-ci/argos-ci.com/builds/20). It allows developers to get a summary of all visual changes introduced by their PR and avoid visual bugs.

## Fit in developer workflow

Thanks to the GitHub integration, the visual review fits perfectly into developer workflows. A GitHub check status is displayed in each PR and notifies you when visual changes are detected. Follow the direct link to either approve or reject the changes. This process ensures that visual changes are intentional and do not cause any extra time burden on users.

## Getting started

Getting started with Argos is easy. The first step is to [install Argos](/installation) on your repository. Then, read our [review changes guide](/review-changes) to learn how to use Argos in your development workflow.
