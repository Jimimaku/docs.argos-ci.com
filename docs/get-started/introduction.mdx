# Introduction

Argos is a visual testing app that detects visual changes on pull requests and notifies the developers on GitHub. Review changes on Argos to avoid visual regressions and ship features with confidence.

You can appreciate Argos' look and feel on the [demo build](https://app.argos-ci.com/lemonde/sirius/builds/15639/new).

- [Powered by Continuous Integration (CI)](#powered-by-continuous-integration-ci)

#### Universal

Take screenshots of a website's whole pages or individual components. No matter the language, browser, or resolution, Argos detects the screenshots' visual changes to prevent your pull requests against visual regression.

#### Fits in your workflow

Argos notifies the comparison result with GitHub check status. Click on the direct link to review the screenshots' visual diffs on Argos.

#### Optimized by design

We designed Argos to offer an overview of all screenshots diffs and, simultaneously, a side-by-side UI to compare a new screenshot with its baseline counterparts.

#### Powered by Continuous Integration (CI)

The CI feeds Argos with screenshots taken during end-to-end tests to protect your applications from visual regressions on each pull request.

## The birth of Argos

We created Argos as a devX tool for our frontend team with two primary purposes: to prevent visual regressions across a big website codebase and ensure UI stability on all browsers and resolutions.

It rapidly spread outside our team borders and became a must-have app for every developer in our company, as preventing visual regressions is an issue for everyone.

Since then, we have installed Argos on every product we have worked on, and the developers teams immediately fell in love with it. In 2022, with more than 10 millions screenshot diffs performed each month, we decided to level up and transform our internal tool into a commercial product.
