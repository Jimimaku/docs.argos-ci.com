# Taking Screenshots

Capture screenshots of your app during your end-to-end (E2E) tests, before invoking the Argos CLI command.

## Utilizing your testing framework

Argos integrates seamlessly with your preferred testing frameworks like Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, and others. Each of these frameworks provides a native screenshot command, which you can use within your E2E tests.

## Enhancing screenshot stability with integrations

Native screenshot commands can sometimes face stability issues. This is particularly true when dealing with loaded resources like images or fonts.

Argos offers integrations to enhance stability. These wait for all page items to load before capturing screenshots. In addition, the integrations provide the ability to selectively hide elements. This results in cleaner test results.

We highly recommend exploring these integrations into your testing framework of choice.
