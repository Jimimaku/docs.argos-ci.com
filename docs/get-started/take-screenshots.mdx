# Taking screenshots with Argos

Argos allows you to compare screenshots taken during your E2E tests to prevent visual regressions on your application. We recommend using a testing framework to make it easy to navigate in your application and take screenshots.

## Integrate with your testing framework

Argos supports a variety of testing frameworks to help you take and compare screenshots easily. Here are some guides to get started with popular testing frameworks:

  <LinkCard to="/playwright" image={playwrightLogo}>
    Playwright
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/puppeteer" image={puppeteerLogo}>
