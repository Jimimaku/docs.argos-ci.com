# Capture Screenshots

The first step in visual testing involves capturing screenshots during End-To-End (E2E) tests of your application.

All modern testing tools provide a native command to capture screenshots. Use these commands to capture screenshots of your pages and protect them from visual regressions.

## Enhancing Screenshot Stability

Native screenshot commands can sometimes struggle with stability issues, especially when dealing with resources like images or fonts that need to be loaded.

Argos integrations offer commands to improve screenshot stability. The `argosScreenshot` command will wait for all resources to load before capturing screenshots. Additionally, these integrations allow selective hiding of elements, leading to cleaner and more accurate test results.

We highly recommend exploring these integrations into your testing framework of choice.
