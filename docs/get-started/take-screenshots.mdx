# Take screenshots

Taking screenshots is the first step in visual testing. With Argos, you can test isolated components, entire pages, or specific stages of a checkout process.

Argos compares screenshot, nothing more. It does not snapshot the DOM, compare HTML or take screenshots. Taking screenshots of your application must be done on your CI. We recommend using a testing framework to make it easy to navigate in your application and take screenshots.

Here are some guides to help you get started with popular testing frameworks:

<Cards>
  <LinkCard to="/cypress" image={cypressLogo}>
    Cypress
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/playwright" image={playwrightLogo}>
    Playwright
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/puppeteer" image={puppeteerLogo}>
    Puppeteer
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/capybara" image={capybaraLogo}>
    Capybara
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/nightwatch" image={nightwatchLogo}>
    Nightwatch
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/selenium" image={seleniumLogo}>
    Selenium
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/test-cafe" image={testCafeLogo}>
    TestCafe
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/webdriver-io" image={webdriverLogo}>
    WebdriverIO
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/other-framework">Other framework...</LinkCard>
</Cards>

Once you got screenshots, it's time to [upload screenshots in CI](/upload-screenshots) to upload them to the Argos visual testing platform.
