# Get started with Argos

Argos is a visual testing app that compares screenshots and notifies developers in GitHub. Follow these steps to install Argos on your repository.

## Set up the GitHub application​

Argos GitHub app will allow Argos to read commits, mirror user accesses, and add pull-request statuses to notify about changes.

Subscribe to an Argos plan on [Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).

You can give Argos access to all of your repositories or choose specific ones. However, we recommend selecting only the repositories on which you want to use Argos.

## Capture the screenshots

The first step to visual testing is to capture screenshots. It's up to you to test isolated components, whole pages, or each stage of a checkout tunnel.

> Tip: It is easier to check page content visually than asserting each text. Moreover, there is no code maintenance when the content is updated.

We recommend leaning on end-to-end testing frameworks to take screenshots. They facilitate navigation through the application and have native commands to take screenshots in various browsers and screen resolutions.

#### Testing framework guide

The following guides that cover our recommended approach to installing Argos in a number of popular testing frameworks.
