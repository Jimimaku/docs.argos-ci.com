# Getting started with Argos

Argos takes less than 10 minutes to install. Follow these steps to set it up into your project.

## Install GitHub App

To get started with Argos, you'll first need to install the Argos GitHub App. This will allow Argos to read commits, mirror user access, and add pull-request statuses to notify you of any changes.

1. Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) and subscribe to a plan
2. Give Argos access to your desired repositories. It is recommended to only select the repositories that you want to use Argos for.
