# Getting Started with Argos

Argos is a powerful visual testing tool that allows developers to easily compare screenshots and detect visual changes in their web applications. With Argos, developers can be notified of visual changes in real-time, directly within GitHub. Follow these simple steps to install and set up Argos on your repository.

  alt="Example build"
  style={{ borderRadius: 8, marginBottom: 10 }}
/>

## Install the Argos GitHub App

To get started with Argos, you'll first need to install the Argos GitHub App. This will allow Argos to read commits, mirror user access, and add pull-request statuses to notify you of any changes.

1. Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) and subscribe to an Argos plan.
2. Give Argos access to your desired repositories. It is recommended to only select the repositories that you want to use Argos for.

  src={githubRepoAccess}
  alt="GitHub repository access"
  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
/>
