# Get started

The Argos CLI is the safe way to send your screenshots to Argos. Your CI should run it after taking the screenshot in the end-to-end tests.

To learn more about Argos' philosophy, read the [Introduction](/introduction).

## Set up the GitHub application​

Argos GitHub plugin will allow Argos to read commits, mirror user accesses, and add pull-request statuses to notify about changes.

[Log in to GitHub](https://github.com/login) and install the [Argos application](https://github.com/apps/argos-ci).

You can give Argos access to all of your repositories or choose specific ones. However, we recommend selecting only the repositories on which you want to use Argos.

  src={githubRepoAccess}
  alt="GitHub repository access"
  className="rounded"
/>

Argos requires the following permissions:

- **Contents** — to find a common commit ancestor between branches
- **Statuses** — to add status on commit
- **Pull requests** — to add a comment in pull requests
- **Actions** — to allow tokenless authentication

## Taking screenshots

Argos relies on screenshots to monitor your application's UI. Use your favorite testing library ([Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/),
[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/),
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/),
etc.) to take screenshots during your end-to-end tests.

You can also use the Argos integrations to improve screenshots' stability and useful valuable commands. Look at the Integrations section of this documentation to check if your stack matches one of them.

You can also use one of many [Argos integrations](/category/cli--integrations) to improve screenshots' stability and benefit from useful commands.

## Upload screenshots

The [official Argos CLI](/argos-cli) is the simplest and fastest way to send screenshots to Argos.

If screenshots are taken during end-to-end tests running on your CI, you have to configure your CI to send screenshots to Argos.

Specific guides help you to set up Argos CLI on your CI:

<CiCards>
  <CICardLink href="/github-actions">
    <CiCard>
      <CiBody>
        <CiCardImage>
          <GithubLogo />
        </CiCardImage>
        <CiCardTitle>Github Actions</CiCardTitle>
      </CiBody>
      <CiArrow />
    </CiCard>
  </CICardLink>
  <CICardLink href="/circle-ci">
    <CiCard>
      <CiBody>
        <CiCardImage>
          <TravisCiLogo />
        </CiCardImage>
        <CiCardTitle>Circle CI</CiCardTitle>
      </CiBody>
      <CiArrow />
    </CiCard>
  </CICardLink>
  <CICardLink href="/travis-ci">
    <CiCard>
      <CiBody>
        <CiCardImage>
          <CircleCiLogo />
        </CiCardImage>
        <CiCardTitle>Travis CI</CiCardTitle>
      </CiBody>
      <CiArrow />
    </CiCard>
  </CICardLink>
</CiCards>

## Enjoy!

Congratulation, Argos is installed on your repository, and you are ready to start the [visual testing](/visual-testing).
