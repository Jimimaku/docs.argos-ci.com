# Getting started with Argos

Argos is a visual testing tool that allows you to catch and prevent visual regressions in your application.
Here's how to get started with Argos in less than 10 minutes:

## Install the GitHub app

To get started with Argos, you'll first need to install the Argos GitHub app. Follow this steps to do so:

1. Go to the [Argos GitHub Marketplace page](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) and subscribe to a plan.

2. After subscribing, GitHub should guide you through the installation process. If not, you can [follow this link](https://github.com/apps/argos-ci/installations/new) to install the Argos app on your account.

3. The last step is to give Argos access to the repositories you want to use it with. We recommend only sharing the repositories that you want to use Argos for.
