# Get started

Argos is a visual testing app that compares screenshots and notify developers in GitHub. Follow this steps to install Argos on your repository.

## Set up the GitHub application​

Argos GitHub plugin will allow Argos to read commits, mirror user accesses, and add pull-request statuses to notify about changes.

[Log in to GitHub](https://github.com/login) and install the [Argos application](https://github.com/apps/argos-ci).

You can give Argos access to all of your repositories or choose specific ones. However, we recommend selecting only the repositories on which you want to use Argos.

      <b>Actions</b> — to allow tokenless authentication

  </ul>

## Capture the screenshots

The first step to visual testing is to capture screenshots. Up to you to test isolated components, whole pages, or each stage of a checkout tunnel.

> Tip: It is easier to visually check page content than asserting each text. Moreover, there is no code maintenance when the content is updated.

We recommend leaning on end-to-end testing frameworks to take screenshots. They facilitate navigation through the application and have native commands to take screenshots in various browsers and screen resolutions.

For some of them, we offer integrations that provide helpful utilities to hide unstable elements from screenshots.

## Next step

The next step is to [configure your CI](/configure-ci) to send screenshots to Argos.
