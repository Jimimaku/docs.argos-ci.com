# Getting started with Argos

Argos is a visual testing tool that helps you catch and prevent visual regressions in your application before they reach production.

Follow these steps to install Argos into your development workflow in a few minutes

1. [Install Argos GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/argos-ci/installations/new)<br/>
   In the installation process, you have to give Argos access to your repositories. We recommend, selecting only the repositories you plan to use Argos on.

2. [Take screenshots](/take-screenshots)<br/>
   Using a testing framework to capture screenshots during E2E tests.

3. [Upload screenshots](/upload-screenshots)<br/>
   Configure your CI workflow to upload screenshot on Argos using the CLI.

Once you've installed Argos, you can now learn how to [review visual changes](/review-changes) in your development workflow.
