# Use Argos to catch Visual Bugs

Once you've successfully installed Argos, it starts receiving a batch of screenshots each time you create a pull request or update your reference branch.

## GitHub/GitLab check status

With Argos in place, your pull requests will feature a new status check that indicates whether visual changes have been detected.

<img
  src={githubWaitingCheckStatus}
  alt="GitHub waiting check status"
  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
/>

Check status is <Tag>‚ùå Waiting for your decision</Tag>

This signifies that potential changes have been detected and GitHub is awaiting your approval. Click on the <Tag>Details</Tag> link to review changes using the Argos app.

**Check status is <Tag>‚úÖ Pass</Tag>**

This indicates no changes have been detected, and you can proceed confidently to merge your pull request.

## Reviewing visual changes

Clicking on the <Tag>Details</Tag> link in the GitHub check status will lead you to the Argos build page.

<img
  src={buildExample}
  alt="Argos build example"
  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
/>

On this page, you'll find all the screenshots generated by your pull request (right), juxtaposed with their prior versions from the reference branch (left). The side-by-side UI has been meticulously designed to help you spot visual changes (highlighted in red) quickly and verify if the frontend conforms to the expected results.

To navigate through the screenshots, you can use the sidebar, navigation buttons, or your keyboard.

Tip: Press <Tag>?</Tag> to display the list of available keyboard shortcuts.

### Rejecting a Build

Should you identify a visual bug or encounter a screenshot not matching your expectations, click on the <Tag>Review changes</Tag> button and select <Tag>üëé Reject changes</Tag>. The build status will update to <Tag>üî¥ Changes rejected</Tag>, and GitHub will be informed of the rejection.

Following a rejection, you should commit a rectifying change to your pull request.

### Approving a Build

If the screenshots align with your expectations, click on the <Tag>Review changes</Tag> button and select <Tag>üëç Approve changes</Tag>. The build status will update to <Tag>üü¢ Changes approved</Tag>, and GitHub will be notified of the approval.

After approving the changes, you can confidently merge your pull request.
