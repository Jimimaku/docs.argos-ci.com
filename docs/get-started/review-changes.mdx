# Review changes

Once the installation is complete, Argos will receive screenshots when you create a pull request or update the [reference branch](/faq#what-is-a-reference-branch). On GitHub, pull requests will now have a new check status indicating if visual changes are detected.

## No changes detected

If no changes are detected, the status is <Tag>‚úÖ Pass</Tag>, and you can confidently merge your pull request.
