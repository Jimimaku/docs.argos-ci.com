# Integrate visual review into development routine

Once installed, Argos receive a screenshots batch when you create a pull request or update your reference branch.

## GitHub check status

Your pull requests will have a new status check indicating if visual changes are detected.

<img
  src={githubWaitingCheckStatus}
  alt="GitHub waiting check status"
  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
/>

**Check status is <Tag>üü† Pending</Tag>**

Some changes had been detected, and GitHub is waiting for your approval. Click on the <Tag>Details</Tag> link to [review changes](#reviewing-visual-changes) into Argos app.

**Check status is <Tag>‚úÖ Pass</Tag>**

No changes detected. You can confidently merge your pull request.

## Reviewing visual changes

The <Tag>Details</Tag> link of Github check status will redirect you to Argos build page.

<img

  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
/>

Here, you will find all the screenshots introduced by your pull request (right) compared to their previous version from the [reference branch](/faq#what-is-a-reference-branch) (left). The side-by-side UI is designed to quickly spot visual changes (red) and swiftly verify if frontend match the expected results.
