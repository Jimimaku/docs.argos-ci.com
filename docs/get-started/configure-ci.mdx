# Configure CI

The official [Argos CLI](/argos-cli) is the simplest and fastest way to send screenshots to Argos. Your CI should use it after taking the screenshot during the end-to-end tests.

## Set up the Argos token

> Note: Github Actions CI users can skip this step as the repository authentication is automatic.

[Login to Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), and click on <img
src={gearButton}
alt="Gear button"
className="rounded"
width={40}
style={{ display: "inline-block", marginBottom: -8 }}
/>
button in front of a repository to get the `ARGOS_TOKEN`. There is an token for each repository.

Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable (sometimes called “secrets”) in your CI configuration.

## Upload the screenshots

Add this command to your CI workflow to upload the screenshot to Argos:

```
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

Sometimes an additional option is required to access the CI environment variable.

**Optional:** You can also add @argos-ci/cli to your package.json to control the dependency version.
