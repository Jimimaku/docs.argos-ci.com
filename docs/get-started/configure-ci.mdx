# Configure CI

The official [Argos CLI](/argos-cli) is the simplest and fastest way to send screenshots to Argos. Therefore, your CI should use it after taking the screenshot during the end-to-end tests.

## Set up the Argos token

> Note: GitHub Actions CI users can skip this step as the repository authentication is automatic.

[Login to Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), and click on the <img
src={gearButton}
alt="Gear button"
className="rounded"
width={40}
style={{ display: "inline-block", marginBottom: -8 }}
/>
button in front of a repository to get the `ARGOS_TOKEN`. There is unique a token for each repository.

Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable (sometimes called “secrets”) in your CI configuration.

## Upload the screenshots

Add this command to your CI workflow to upload the screenshot to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

Sometimes an additional option is required to access the CI environment variable.

> **Optional:** You can add [@argos-ci/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@argos-ci/cli) to your package.json to control the dependency version.
