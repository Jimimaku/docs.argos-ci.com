# Capture Screenshots for Visual Testing

Capturing screenshots is the first step in visual testing. With Argos, you can test isolated components, entire pages, or specific stages of a checkout process. We recommend using a testing framework to make it easy to navigate your application and capture screenshots.

Here are some guides to help you get started with popular testing frameworks:

<Cards>
  <LinkCard to="/cypress" image={cypressLogo}>
    Cypress
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/playwright" image={playwrightLogo}>
    Playwright
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/puppeteer" image={puppeteerLogo}>
    Puppeteer
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/capybara" image={capybaraLogo}>
    Capybara
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/nightwatch" image={nightwatchLogo}>
    Nightwatch
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/selenium" image={seleniumLogo}>
    Selenium
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/test-cafe" image={testCafeLogo}>
    TestCafe
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/webdriver-io" image={webdriverLogo}>
    WebdriverIO
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/other-framework">Other framework...</LinkCard>
</Cards>

Once you have captured your screenshots, it's time to [configure your CI](/configure-ci) to upload them to the Argos visual testing platform.
