# Upload screenshots

Once you got screenshots of your applications, you have to upload them on Argos to create a build and compares them.

Uploading screenshots can be done locally by yourself but to work efficiently it has to be done in continuous integration. The [Argos CLI](/argos-cli) is the easiest and fastest way to upload screenshots to the Argos visual testing platform.

Here are some guides to help you upload screenshots with popular CI tools:

<Cards>
  <LinkCard to="/github-actions" image={githubLogo}>
    GitHub Actions
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/circle-ci" image={circleCiLogo}>
    CircleCI
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/travis-ci" image={travisLogo}>
    Travis CI
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/buildkite" image={buildkiteLogo}>
    Buildkite
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/codeship" image={codeshipLogo}>
    CodeShip
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/drone-ci" image={droneLogo}>
    Drone
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/gitlab-ci" image={gitlabLogo}>
    GitLab CI
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/semaphore-ci" image={semaphoreLogo}>
    Semaphore
  </LinkCard>
  <LinkCard to="/semaphore-ci">Other CI...</LinkCard>
</Cards>
