# Vercel

If you are using Vercel to develop, preview, and ship your application, you can natively integrate with Argos by installing the official integration from the Vercel Marketplace.

The Vercel integration will help you by:

1. Automatically running visual tests to identify any visual discrepancies and anomalies as your web page renders.
2. Enabling you to run visual testing against preview and production deployments on Vercel.

## Installation

To Install Argos's native Vercel Integration, navigate to your "Project Settings" and click on "Vercel" button, then on "Vercel Marketplace" button.

<img
  src={vercelInstallation}
  alt="Vercel Installation from Project"
  className="rounded"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20, width: 600 }}
/>

On the Vercel Marketplace page, click on "Add Integration".

Next, follow the installation wizard to grant the integration access to the right Vercel scope and projects.

You can choose to map your Vercel projects to existing projects on your Argos account, to have them run on production and/or preview deployments.
