# Responsive Viewports

## Supported Integrations

This feature is available in the following integrations. Refer to the respective integration guide for specific setup instructions.

## Configuring Viewports

To tailor viewport settings, modify the `argosScreenshot()` command within your tests. This allows for capturing responsive views using either specific dimensions or predefined device presets:

```js
await argosScreenshot(..., {
  viewports: [
    "iphone-4", // Device preset
    { width: 800, height: 600 }, // Direct dimensions
    { preset: "ipad-2", orientation: "landscape" }, // Preset with options
  ],
});
```

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

Setting the viewport using `page.setViewportSize()` will resize the page. However, many websites are not designed to adapt dynamically to different viewport sizes. Thus, it's recommended to set the viewport size **before** navigating to the page.

It is recommended to run your entire test suite on a specific viewport to be sure everything is working as expected on every resolution.
