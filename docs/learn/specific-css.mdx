# Argos-specific CSS

Understand the method for using Argos-focused CSS to exclude certain sections from appearing in your screenots.

In addition to [Argos built-in helpers](https://argos-ci.com/docs/argos-helpers#helpers), Argos integrations offer the possibility to inject custom CSS applied during the screenshot process. It can be helpful for complex use cases that produce flaky visual diffs.

## `argosCSS` SDK options

All our SDKs supports an `argosCSS` options that allows you to specify custom CSS evaluated during the screenshot phase. The style will be removed from the page after the screenshot is taken.

```ts
// Playwright / Puppeteer
await argosScreenshot(page, "my-screenshot", {
  argosCSS: `iframe { display: none }`,
});

// Cypress
cy.argosScreenshot("my-screenshot", {
  argosCSS: `iframe { display: none }`,
});
```

## Argos CSS global class

During the screenshot phase, Argos adds the `__argos__` class to the html element. This enables you to incorporate Argos-specific CSS directly into your styles.

```css
.__argos__ iframe {
  display: none;
}
```
