# Injecting CSS

Argos integrations offer the possibility to inject custom CSS applied during the screenshot process to improve your screenshots or exclude some details.

## Usage

The `argosScreenshot()` command allows you to specify a `customCSS` option to inject CSS before capturing a screenshot. The style will be removed after the screenshot is taken.

```ts
// CSS to inject
const CUSTOM_STYLE = `iframe { display: none; }`;

// Playwright and Puppeteer
await argosScreenshot(page, "my-screenshot", { argosCSS: CUSTOM_STYLE });

// Cypress
cy.argosScreenshot("my-screenshot", { argosCSS: CUSTOM_STYLE });
```

## Use Argos class

During the screenshot phase, Argos adds the `__argos__` class to the html element. This enables you to incorporate Argos-specific CSS directly into your styles.

```css
.__argos__ iframe {
  display: none;
}
```
