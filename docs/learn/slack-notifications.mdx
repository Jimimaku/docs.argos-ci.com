_Example of a Slack notification sent by Argos_

## Set up Slack notifications

Set up a Slack notification rule using Argos automations.

1. Go to the **Automations** tab in your Argos project and click on **New Automation**.
2. Name your automation, e.g., "Notify Slack on build completion".
3. Under **WHEN**, select one or several events that will trigger the notification.
4. (Optional) Under **IF**, add conditions such as "Build type is check".

   <img
     src={automationConditions}
     alt="Automation conditions example"
     className="rounded"
     style={{ marginBottom: 30, marginTop: 0, paddingTop: 0, width: 600 }}
   />

5. Under **THEN**, choose the action **Send notification to Slack**.

   If this is your first time using Slack with Argos, click **Connect to Slack** and follow the connection flow.

6. Select the Slack channel and optionally provide the channel ID.

   <img
     src={slackChannelId}
     alt="Locate Slack channel ID"
     className="rounded"
     style={{ marginBottom: 30, marginTop: 0, paddingTop: 0, width: 600 }}
   />

7. Click **Send test notification** to verify the connection. A test message will be sent to the selected channel.
8. Click **Create Rule** to activate it.

## Common use cases

- Post only failed builds to #build-failures

## Troubleshooting and Tips

- Make sure the Argos app is authorized in your Slack workspace.
- For private channels, manually invite the bot with `/invite @Argos`.
- Only Argos team admins can configure Slack integrations.
- You can test notifications anytime using **Send test notification**.
