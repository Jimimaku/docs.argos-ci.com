# Run on Preview Deployments

You can run Argos on a Preview Deployment. Vercel, Cloudflare or Netlify are supported.

## Vercel + GitHub Action

First be sure that your repository is correctly connected to Vercel. Read the [Vercel guide](https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-run-end-to-end-tests-after-my-vercel-preview-deployment) for more information.

This setup runs Playwright tests after a successful Vercel deployment. If you didn't setup Argos + Playwright, read our [quickstart guide](/quickstart/playwright).

Create a GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows` with the following:

```yml
name: Playwright + Argos Tests

on:
  deployment_status:
jobs:
  run-e2es:
    if: github.event_name == 'deployment_status' && github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci && npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Run tests
        run: npx playwright test
        env:
          # Use this environment variable as `baseUrl` in your plawright.config.ts
          BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.environment_url }}
          # Argos uses GITHUB_TOKEN to collect branch and pull request informations
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Set the branch when your deployment runs on "Production" environment.
          ARGOS_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.environment == 'Production' && 'main' || '' }}
```
