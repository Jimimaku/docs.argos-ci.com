# Injecting CSS

Argos allows custom CSS injection in screenshots for more control over visual output.

In addition to [Argos built-in helpers](https://argos-ci.com/docs/argos-helpers#helpers), Argos integrations provide the capability to inject custom CSS into your screenshots. This feature is particularly useful in complex scenarios for excluding certain elements or addressing flaky visual differences.

## Custom CSS Injection

Use the `customCSS` option in `argosScreenshot()` to apply temporary CSS before a screenshot. This CSS is removed post-capture.

```ts
// Define CSS
const CUSTOM_STYLE = `iframe { display: none; }`;

// Usage in Playwright and Puppeteer
await argosScreenshot(page, "my-screenshot", { customCSS: CUSTOM_STYLE });

// Usage in Cypress
cy.argosScreenshot("my-screenshot", { customCSS: CUSTOM_STYLE });
```

## Argos-Specific Styles

Argos adds a `__argos__` class to the HTML element during screenshots. You can target this class in your CSS for Argos-specific styling.

```css
.__argos__ iframe {
  display: none;
}
```

This feature enhances control over the visual testing environment, helping to manage complex scenarios or resolve flaky visual differences.
