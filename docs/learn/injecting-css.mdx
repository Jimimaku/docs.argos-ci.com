# Injecting CSS

Learn how to inject CSS before taking a screenshot.

In addition to [Argos built-in helpers](https://argos-ci.com/docs/argos-helpers#helpers), Argos offer the possibility to inject custom CSS applied during the screenshot process. It can be helpful for complex use cases that produce flaky visual diffs.

## Custom CSS Injection

All our SDKs supports an `argosCSS` options that allows you to specify custom CSS evaluated during the screenshot phase. The style will be removed from the page after the screenshot is taken.

```ts
// Define CSS
const CUSTOM_STYLE = `iframe { display: none; }`;

// Usage in Playwright and Puppeteer
await argosScreenshot(page, "my-screenshot", { argosCSS: CUSTOM_STYLE });

// Usage in Cypress
cy.argosScreenshot("my-screenshot", { argosCSS: CUSTOM_STYLE });
```

## Argos-Specific Styles

Argos adds a `__argos__` class to the HTML element during screenshots. You can target this class in your CSS for Argos-specific styling.

```css
.__argos__ iframe {
  display: none;
}
```

This feature enhances control over the visual testing environment, helping to manage complex scenarios or resolve flaky visual differences.
