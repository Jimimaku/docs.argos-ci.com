# Invoiced Customers

Purchase Argos plan for GitHub invoiced account.

> "Unfortunately, invoiced customers cannot purchase paid plans on the GitHub Marketplace."<br/> **â€” GitHub error message**

This message is displayed when an invoiced Github account tries to subscribe to Argos' plan on GitHub Marketplace.

For these customers, we offer an alternative payment method via Stripe.
