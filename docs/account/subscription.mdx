# Subscription

Argos offers a free and unlimited plan for open-source repositories as a way of thanking the community. For private repositories, the Free plan allows you to upload up to 5,000 screenshots per month. If your account requires more, you can subscribe to a paid plan.

You can subscribe to Argos' paid plan via [GitHub Marketplace](#subscribe-via-github-marketplace) or [Stripe](#subscribe-via-stripe).

## Subscribe via GitHub Marketplace

To subscribe to Argos' plan, visit the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci). Your Argos subscription will be charged on your GitHub invoices, so we do not require your credit card or financial information.

#### Manage a plan subscribed via GitHub Marketplace

You can update (or cancel) your plan on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).<br/>

> Note: You may have multiple Argos subscriptions associated with different accounts.

## Subscribe via Stripe

If you need to subscribe with Stripe, you must cancel any previous subscription taken via GitHub Marketplace.

The Stripe subscription process takes place in the Argos app:

1. [Log in into Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your account and click on the "Settings" tab.<br/>
   **Be careful to be on the intended account (personal or organization).**
2. Click on the link "Subscribe to plan using Stripe" to display the pricing list.

3. Choose a plan to be redirected to the Stripe payment platform.

Upon completion of payment, you will receive a confirmation email that includes the invoice.
