### Usage monitoring

To monitor your usage in Argos, you can view the current month's usage for each of your accounts in Argos' settings:

- Personal account: https://app.argos-ci.com/[personal-login]/settings
- Organization's account: https://app.argos-ci.com/[organization-login]/settings

### Exceeding Plan Capacity

If you are approaching the limit of your current plan, you will be notified in Argos.

If you exceed your plan's threshold, you must [upgrade your plan](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).

### What happens if you exceed your plan's limit?

If you exceed your plan's limit, you will not be able to upload additional screenshots to Argos until the start of the next billing period.
