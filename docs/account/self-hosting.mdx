# Self-hosted GitHub Enterprise

Thank you for your interest in self-hosting Argos. We appreciate your desire to have more control over your hosting environment and are committed to providing the best possible service to our customers.

At this time, we are unable to offer a self-hosted option for Argos SaaS. Our team is small and focused on delivering the best possible experience for our customers using the SaaS model.

We understand that self-hosting is an important option for some businesses, and we are actively working on a solution that will allow us to offer this in the future. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and we encourage you to check back with us in the future for updates on our progress.

In the meantime, we are confident that you will find our SaaS offering to be reliable, secure, and feature-rich. If you have any questions or concerns about our SaaS model, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for choosing Argos SaaS.
