# Account

Argos relies on GitHub Marketplace to handle the subscriptions and billing. Therefore, we mirror the GitHub system and distinguish personal accounts from organizational ones.

## Pricing model

#### Free for open-source repositories

Argos' usage for open-source repositories is free and unlimited. It's our way to thank the community for their work and what they have offered us through the years.

#### Private repositories

For the moment, the Argos **Free plan** is unlimited for private repositories. However, very soon, it will be limited to 5.000 screenshots diffs per month.

## Subscription

Subscribe to Argos' plan on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci). However, a subscription is not required until you reach the **Free plan** threshold.

> Note: You may have multiple Argos subscriptions related to different accounts.

### Current month's usage

Find the current month's usage for each of your accounts on Argos' settings :

- https://app.argos-ci.com/[personal-login]/settings
- https://app.argos-ci.com/[organization-login]/settings

### Exceed plan capacity

A banner will notify you in Argos when you approach the limit of your current plan.

If you exceed your plan threshold, you must [upgrade your plan](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci). Otherwise, you won't be able to upload more screenshots to Argos until next month's renewal.

### Change plan

You can change your Argos plan on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).

Don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact-us) if none of the offered plans satisfy your consumption.

## Invoices

Argos' subscription will be charged on your GitHub invoices. Thanks to this, we don't require your credit card or financial information.

## Cancel a subscription

You can cancel your Argos subscription on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) or on GitHub [billing and plan settings](https://github.com/settings/billing).
