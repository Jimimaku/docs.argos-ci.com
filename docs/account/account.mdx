# Account

Argos relies on GitHub Marketplace to handle the subscriptions and billing. Therefore, we mirror the GitHub system and distinguish personal accounts from organizational ones.

## Pricing model

#### Free for open-source repositories

Argos' usage for open-source repositories is free and unlimited. It's our way to thank the community for their work and what they have offered us through the years.

#### Private repositories

For the moment, Argos is free and unlimited. However, very soon, the **Free plan** will be limited to 5.000 screenshots diffs per month for private repositories.

<!---
By default, an account that uses less than 5.000 screenshots diffs/month uses the **Free plan**. If you exceed this threshold, you must subscribe to a [paid plan on GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci). Otherwise, you won't be able to upload more screenshots to Argos until next month's renewal.

## Subscription

Subscribe to Argos' plan on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).

> Note: no need to subscribe to a plan until you reach the free plan threshold. A banner will notify you in Argos when you approach the limit.

## Consumption monitoring

You can check the monthly consumption for each of your accounts on Argos' settings :

- https://app.argos-ci.com/[personal-login]/settings
- https://app.argos-ci.com/[organization-login]/settings

## Billing

Argos' subscription will be charged on your GitHub invoices. Thanks to this, we don't require your credit card or financial information.

## Cancel a subscription

You can cancel an Argos subscription on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) or on GitHub [billing and plan settings](https://github.com/settings/billing).

Be careful; you may possess multiple subscriptions on different accounts.
