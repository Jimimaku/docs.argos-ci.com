# Billing

Argos relies on GitHub Marketplace to handle subscriptions and billing. As a result, we use a system similar to GitHub's, with distinctions made between personal and organizational accounts.

## Pricing model

#### Free for open-source repositories

The use of Argos for open-source repositories is free and unlimited as a way of thanking the community for their contributions.

#### Private repositories

The **Free Plan** allows for up to 5,000 screenshot diffs per month. If your organization requires more credits, you can [subscribe to a paid plan](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).

## Subscription

To subscribe to Argos' plan, visit the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci).

### Current month's usage

You can view the current month's usage for each of your accounts in Argos' settings:

- https://app.argos-ci.com/[personal-login]/settings
- https://app.argos-ci.com/[organization-login]/settings

### Exceed plan capacity

If you are approaching the limit of your current plan, you will be notified in Argos.

If you exceed your plan's threshold, you must [upgrade your plan](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci). If you do not, you will not be able to upload additional screenshots to Argos until the start of the next billing period.

### Change plan

You can change your Argos plan on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci). If none of the offered plans meet your needs, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:contact@argos-ci.com).

## Invoices

Your Argos subscription will be charged on your GitHub invoices, so we do not require your credit card or financial information.

## Cancel a subscription

You can cancel your Argos subscription on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/argos-ci) or in the [billing and plan settings](https://github.com/settings/billing) on GitHub.

> Note: You may have multiple Argos subscriptions associated with different accounts.
