# Wait for Loading

Use `aria-busy` with Argos to control screenshot timing.

## Usage

`argosScreenshot()` delays capturing screenshots until no elements with `aria-busy` are detected, ensuring full page load.

```jsx
<Loader aria-busy={true} />
```

**We recommend to apply `aria-busy` on your loader components be ensure that your page is fully loaded before a screenshot is taken.**
