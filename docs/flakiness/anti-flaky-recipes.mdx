# Anti-flaky recipes

Here are some recipes that we recommend running in the tested pages and waiting for them to resolve before taking a screenshot.

At Argos we believe that end-to-end testing should rely on accessibility. A bot can be compared to a blind person navigating in the application. That's why in these recipes we rely a lot of accessiblity of your application.

Making your application more accessible will reduce its flakiness.

## Loading state

All our integrations automatically check for the presence of `[aria-busy="true"]` elements on the page, which can indicate that something is still loading.

By adding `aria-busy="true"` on your loader you make your users and Argos automatically wait for your page to be fully loaded before screenshoting it.
