# Browser Glitches

Some graphic glitches can be experienced because of unstable rendering engine of browsers.

Glitches can occur when your tests are not running in the same environment. Be sure to run your E2E tests in the exact same environment (OS and Browser).

## Border Radius

Sometimes, the `border-radius` property can cause screenshots to appear differently across different browsers or devices.

To address this, you can add the `data-visual-test-no-radius` Argos helper to remove the border radius while taking screenshots.

```html
<button className="rounded" data-visual-test-no-radius>My button</button>
```
