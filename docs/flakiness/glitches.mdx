# Stabilize glitches

Some graphic glitches can be experienced because of unstable rendering engine of browsers. Here are some solutions to stabilize rendering.

## Border radius

Sometimes, the `border-radius` property can cause screenshots to appear differently across different browsers or devices.

To address this, you can add the `data-visual-test-no-radius` Argos helper to remove the border radius while taking screenshots.

```html
<button className="rounded" data-visual-test-no-radius>My button</button>
```

## Other glitches

Glitches can occur when your tests are not running in the same environment. Be sure to run your E2E tests in the exact same environment (OS and Browser).
