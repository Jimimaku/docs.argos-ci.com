# Stabilize Date & Time

Date and time are changing by nature, displaying them in UI is often a source of flakiness. Here are some solutions to solve it properly.

## Hiding the Date

Using Argos helpers, you can choose to hide a date or a time by adding `data-visual-test="transparent"`.

```html
<time data-visual-test="transparent">10 oct, 2012</time>
```

## Freezing the Date

If you are using dates (not precise time), you can stabilize them in your seeds by running a script that updates dates just before running your E2E tests.
