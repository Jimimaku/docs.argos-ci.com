# Stabilize dates

Dates are changing by nature, displaying them in UI is often a source of flakiness. Here are some solutions to solve it properly.

## Freezing the Date

If the displayed date is not the primary focus of the test, it may be helpful to freeze the date to a fixed value.

This can be done using the native command of your end-to-end testing framework, such as:

```js
/* Cypress command to freeze date to 20 May 2030 */
const now = new Date(2030, 4, 20);
cy.clock(now);
```

Alternatively, you can use an external library like [MockDate](https://github.com/boblauer/MockDate) to mock the current date.

## Hiding the Date

If neither of these methods are effective, you can try hiding the node that displays the date from the screenshot using [CSS Preflight](/css-preflight). This can be done by adding the following CSS to your style injection:

```css
[data-test-date] {
  display: none !important;
}
```

Then, add the data-test-date attribute to the element that displays the date in your HTML. This will hide the element from the screenshot.
