# Configuring Viewports in integrations

With Argos, you can specify the viewport sizes for your visual tests using the `viewports` option in the JavaScript API. This allows you to simulate how your web application or site looks on various devices, be it mobile, tablet, or desktop.

## How to Configure

You can set the viewport in several formats:

1. **Using Presets**:
   Use the name of the supported device preset. For instance:

   ```js
   {
     viewports: ["iphone-4", "macbook-15"];
   }
   ```

2. **Using Presets with Additional Options**:
   If you want to specify additional properties like `orientation`, you can use an object format. Example:

   ```js
   {
     viewports: [
       {
         preset: "ipad-2",
         orientation: "landscape",
       },
     ];
   }
   ```

3. **Custom Dimensions**:
   If you need a viewport size that's not in the preset list, you can specify custom dimensions:

   ```js
   {
     viewports: [{ width: 800, height: 600 }];
   }
   ```

It is also possible to mix formats:

```js
{
  viewports: ["iphone-4", { width: 800, height: 600 }];
}
```

## Supported integrations with `viewports`

Argos offers the viewports configuration option exclusively through its official integration plugins. Below is a list of supported integrations:

- [Playwright](/playwright)
- [Cypress](/cypress)
- [Puppeteer](/puppeteer)

## Important Note

Setting the viewport using `page.setViewportSize()` will resize the page. However, many websites are not designed to adapt dynamically to different viewport sizes. Thus, it's recommended to set the viewport size **before** navigating to the page.

It is recommended to run your entire test suite on a specific viewport to be sure everything is working as expected on every resolution.
