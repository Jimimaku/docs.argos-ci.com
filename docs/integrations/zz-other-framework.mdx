# Use Argos with Another Testing Framework

To integrate Argos with other testing frameworks to enable visual testing for your application, you can use the built-in screenshot command. However, we recommend modifying this command to improve the stability of the rendering.

For guidance on which code snippets to inject into tested pages before taking screenshots, refer to the [CSS Preflight](/css-preflight) and [anti-flaky recipes](/anti-flaky-recipes) documentation.

If you can't find an example for your specific testing framework in our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples), don't hesitate to contribute!
