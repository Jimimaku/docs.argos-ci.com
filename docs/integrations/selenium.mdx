# Use Argos with Selenium

Integrating Argos with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to enable visual testing on your application.

You can use Selenium to take screenshots of your application. However, we recommend overloading the screenshot command to improve the rendering stability.

Read the [style injection](/style-injection) and [code injection](/code-injection) docs to know which snippets you should inject in tested pages before taking screenshots.

Check our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples) to see if there is an example for your testing framework. If not, don't hesitate to contribute!
