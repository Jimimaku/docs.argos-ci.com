# Use Argos with another testing framework

Integrating Argos with another testing framework to enable visual testing on your application.

Most testing frameworks have a command to take screenshots. However, we recommend overloading the native command to improve the screenshots' stability.

Read the [style injection](/style-injection) and [code injection](/code-injection) docs to know which snippets you should inject in tested pages before taking screenshots. Your testing framework should provide a command to execute JavaScript functions in the tested pages and wait for their resolution.

Check our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples) to see if there is an example for your testing framework. If not, don't hesitate to contribute!
