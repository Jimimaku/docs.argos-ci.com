# Use Argos with Webdriver IO

Integrating Argos with WebdriverIO to enable visual testing on your application.

The WebdriverIO native integration is not yet available.

If you use WebdriverIO to take the screenshot, we recommend overloading the native command to improve screenshot stability.

Read the [style injection](/style-injection) and [code injection](/code-injection) docs to know which snippets you should inject in tested pages before taking screenshots.

Check our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples) to see if there is an example for your testing framework. If not, don't hesitate to contribute!
