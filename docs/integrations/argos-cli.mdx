# Argos Command Line Interface (CLI)

Argos CLI is the simplest and fastest way to send screenshots to the Argos app. You can use it locally, but it is designed to be executed by CI.

`@argos-ci/cli` is available as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@argos-ci/cli) and open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos-javascript/tree/main/packages/cli).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cli
```

## Configuration

To use `@argos-ci/cli` you have to configure your repository token in an environment variable.

Read [set up the argos token](/configure-ci#set-up-the-argos-token) to know how to get the `ARGOS_TOKEN` value for your repository.

```sh
ARGOS_TOKEN=<your-repository-token>
```

> Note: It is also possible specify the token with the `--token=<your-repository-token> ` argument instead of using an environment variable but it is not recommended.

## Usage

Use `argos upload` command to upload the screenshots stored in `./screenshots` folder.

```sh
npx argos upload ./screenshots
```

Use the `argos help` command to get available options:

```sh
npx argos help upload
```

## Advanced usage

### Run multiple Argos builds on the same commit

Assign a name to the Argos build with `--build-name` argument to run multiple builds for the same commit.

In this example we create one build for components and another for E2E:

```sh
argos upload --build-name components ./screenshots/components
argos upload --build-name e2e ./screenshots/e2e
```

### Parallel test suites

Parallelism is a common way to speed up test suites by running multiple tests concurrently and then combining results at the end.

To configure parallel test suites using `@argos-ci/cli`, you have to setup two environment variables:

- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE`: a unique build ID for this parallel build. Argos groups uploaded screenshots using this ID.
- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL`: the number of parallel nodes being ran. `argos upload` command must be called exactly up to this number.

> Note: It is also possible to configure parallel mode using the arguments `--parallel-nonce` and `--parallel-total`.

Once configured, upload commands can be ran multiple times and will aggregate screenshots in the same build.

```sh
ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE=<unique-build-id> ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL=<total-batch-count> argos upload --parallel ./screenshots
```
