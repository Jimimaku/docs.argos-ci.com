# Argos Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Argos Command Line Interface (CLI) easiest and fastest way to upload screenshots to the Argos visual testing platform.
It should be exectuted by your CI.

`@argos-ci/cli` is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@argos-ci/cli) and its source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos-javascript/tree/main/packages/cli).

## Installation

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

## Configuration

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your repository settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. Expose an environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` with the value you copied in the previous step.

Depending the CI you use, you may have to set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as a secret in the settings.

> Note: Instead of using an environment variable, you can also specify the token with the `--token=<your-repository-token>` argument, but this is not recommended.

## Usage

### Upload Command

Use the `upload` command to upload screenshots stored in the ./screenshots folder:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

### Help Command

To see a list of available options, use the argos help command:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli help upload" />

## Advanced Usage

### Running Multiple Argos Builds on the Same Commit

To run multiple builds for the same commit, assign a name to the Argos build using the `--build-name` argument.

In this example, we create one build for components and another for E2E:

<RunPkgCommand
  command={[
    "@argos-ci/cli upload --build-name components ./screenshots/components",
    "@argos-ci/cli upload --build-name e2e ./screenshots/e2e",
  ]}
/>

### Parallel Test Suites

Parallelism is a technique for speeding up test suites by running multiple tests concurrently and then combining the results at the end.

To configure parallel test suites using `@argos-ci/cli`, you need to set two environment variables:

- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE`: a unique build ID for this parallel build. Argos groups uploaded screenshots using this ID.
- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL`: the total number of parallel nodes being run. argos upload must be called exactly this number of times.

> Note: It is also possible to configure parallel mode using the `--parallel-nonce` and `--parallel-total` arguments.

Once configured, the `@argos-ci/cli upload` command can be run multiple times to aggregate screenshots in the same build

```sh
export ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE=<unique-build-id>
export ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL=<total-batch-count>
```

<RunPkgCommand command="npx @argos-ci/cli upload --parallel ./screenshots" />
