# Use Argos with Nightwatch

Integrating Argos with [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/) enables visual testing on your application.

We recommend overloading the screenshot command to improve rendering stability when using Nightwatch to take screenshots of your application. For more information, see the [style injection](/style-injection) and [code injection](/code-injection) docs.

To see examples of using Argos with different testing frameworks, check out our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples). If you don't see an example for your testing framework, consider contributing one!
