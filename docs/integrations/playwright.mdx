# Use Argos with Playwright

Integrating Argos with Playwright to enable visual testing on your application.

The Playwright native integration is not yet available. But you it should be very similar to the [Puppeteer integration](/puppeteer).

If you use Playwright to take the screenshot, we recommend overloading the native command to improve screenshot stability.

Read the [style injection](/style-injection) and [code injection](/code-injection) docs to know which snippets you should inject in tested pages before taking screenshots.

Check our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples) to see if there is an example for your testing framework. If not, don't hesitate to contribute!
