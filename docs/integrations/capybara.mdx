# Use Argos with Capybara

Integrating Argos with [Capybara](http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/) enables visual testing on your application.

We recommend overloading the screenshot command to improve rendering stability when using Capybara to take screenshots of your application. For more information, see the [CSS Preflight](/css-preflight) and [anti-flaky recipes](/anti-flaky-recipes) docs.

To see examples of using Argos with different testing frameworks, check out our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples). If you don't see an example for your testing framework, consider contributing one!
