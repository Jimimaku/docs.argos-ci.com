# Use Argos with Capybara

Integrating Argos with Capybara to enable visual testing on your application.

Argo's developers are not fluent in Ruby, so the Capybara native integration is not yet available. But, as some of our users are working on it, a Capybara integration should be doable.

If you use capybara to take the screenshot, we recommend overloading the native command to improve screenshot stability.

Read the [style injection](/style-injection) and [code injection](/code-injection) docs to know which snippets you should inject in tested pages before taking screenshots.

Check our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples) to see if there is an example for your testing framework. If not, don't hesitate to contribute!
