# About flaky tests

Visual flaky tests are screenshots that display random variations. They are annoying because they invalidate GitHub status checks and neutralize visual testing's first purpose: easily spot visual changes.

Some flaky test use cases, like [date stabilization](/date-stabilization), are well-known and easy to fix. But on the other hand, some of them need excellent engineering skills.

This section will provide the tools to fix the most common ones.

> Note: We don't provide the "mark test as a flaky" button because missing a false negative result is more damaging than removing the test.
