# Date stabilization

Strategies to stabilize date on screenshots

## Freeze the date

When a displayed date is not the primary purpose of a test, it can be convenient to freeze it to a fixed value.

You can use your end-to-end testing framework native command :

```js
/* Cypress command to freeze date to 20 May 2030 */
const now = new Date(2030, 4, 20);
cy.clock(now);
```

Or you can use an external library, like [MockDate](https://github.com/boblauer/MockDate), to mock the current date.

## Hide data

If none of these methods work, you can hide the node DOM from the screenshots with [style injection](/style-injection).
