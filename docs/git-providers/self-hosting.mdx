# Self Hosting or On-Premise

Thank you for your interest in self-hosting Argos. We understand that self-hosting is an important option for some businesses, and we are committed to providing the best possible service to our customers.

Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer a self-hosted option for Argos. Our team is small and focused on delivering the best possible experience for our customers using the SaaS model. However, we are actively working on a solution that will allow us to offer self-hosting in the future.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and encourage you to check back with us for updates on our progress. In the meantime, we are confident that our SaaS offering is reliable, secure, and feature-rich. If you have any questions or concerns about our SaaS model, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for considering Argos SaaS.
