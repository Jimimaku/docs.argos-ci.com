# GitLab

Integrate [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) with Argos.

## 1.Create a GitLab Bot User

:::info
Note: Argos uses a personal access token to update commit statuses on GitLab. These API calls are made on behalf of a GitLab user that you specify when you generate a personal access token. You may wish to create a separate GitLab user that has access to only the GitLab projects you wish to integrate with Argos. This allows you to restrict the scope of the API access you provide us and make it clear to your organization how commit statuses are being set.
:::

Create a new user in your GitLab.com organization. We recommend calling it “Argos”, so it’s easily identified.

In GitLab, go to the project you want to integrate Argos with and grant your bot user “Developer” access to it.

Go to https://gitlab.com/NAMESPACE/PROJECT/-/project_members
Grant the bot user you created above with access to your projects using the role “Developer”.

## 2. Generate a Personal Access Token

Once you have created a bot user and invited them to the GitLab project you intend to use with Argos, generate a [personal access token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with **api** scope and no expiration date.

## 3. Add the Personal Access Token to Argos

You’re ready to add that access token to Argos. Go to your Team Settings and paste the personal access token into the GitLab personal token section.

You’ve now installed the GitLab integration! You can now choose to import a project from GitLab or to link an existing project in settings.

## GitLab self-hosted

For now Argos does not support GitLab self-hosted. If you are interested by this integration, please [contact us](/contact-us).
