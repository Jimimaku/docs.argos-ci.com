# Parallel Testing

Parallelism, also known as Sharding, enhances test suite efficiency by concurrently executing tests. Argos optimizes this process, automating the configuration.

For `@argos-ci/cli`, parallelism is controlled via:

- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL`: Number of parallel nodes. Equal calls to Argos upload are required.
- `ARGOS_PARALLEL_NONCE`: Unique identifier for the build. Argos automatically generates this for most CI environments.

> **Note:** Alternatively, use `--parallel-nonce` and `--parallel-total` flags with the CLI.

## GitHub Actions Example

```yml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
- name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
  continue-on-error: true
  env:
    ARGOS_PARALLEL_TOTAL: ${{ strategy['job-total'] }}
  run: npm exec argos upload --parallel ./screenshots
```
