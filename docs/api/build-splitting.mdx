# Build splitting

In certain scenarios, you may want to run multiple Argos builds for the same commit. This can be particularly useful if you have different sets of screenshots, such as component screenshots and end-to-end (E2E) testing screenshots.

To achieve this, you can assign a distinct name to each Argos build using the `--build-name` argument.

## Example

Consider an example where you have one set of screenshots for components and another for E2E tests. You can create separate builds for these by using the following commands:

<RunPkgCommand
  command={[
    "argos upload --build-name components ./screenshots/components",
    "argos upload --build-name e2e ./screenshots/e2e",
  ]}
/>
