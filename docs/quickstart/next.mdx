# Next Quickstart

Learn how to connect your Next project to Argos.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that:

- You have a [Next project installed](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
- Playwright [is installed](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright) in your project.
- A CI/CD setup running your E2E tests

## Prerequisites

Ensure that:

- Playwright [is installed](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright) in your project.
- A CI/CD setup running your E2E tests

## 1. Install packages

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/playwright" />

## 2. Update Playwright config file

Configure Playwright to capture screenshots on test failures and to use the Argos reporter in CI environments.

In your `playwright.config.ts`, add:

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  use: {
    // Capture a screenshot when a test fails
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",

    // Keeps traces for failed tests
    trace: "retain-on-failure",
  },

  // Adds Argos reporter in CI environments
  reporter: process.env.CI
    ? [["list"], ["@argos-ci/playwright/reporter"]]
    : "list",
});
```

## 3. Capture screenshots

In your E2E tests, use `argosScreenshot` to capture stable screenshots.

For example:

```js title="tests/homepage.spec.ts"
test("screenshot homepage", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://localhost:3000");
  await argosScreenshot(page, "homepage");
});
```

## 4. Set up a Project in Argos

<SetUpProjectInArgos />

## 5. Setup your CI

Quickly integrate Argos with your CI setup:

- **GitHub Actions** — No extra setup required! Argos works out-of-the-box with Playwright and GitHub Actions, using a tokenless strategy for pull requests.

- **Other CI Platforms** — Simply add `ARGOS_TOKEN` to your CI environment variables.
