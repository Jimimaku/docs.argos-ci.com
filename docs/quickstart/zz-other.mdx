# Use Argos with Another Testing Framework

To integrate Argos with other testing frameworks to enable visual testing for your application, you can use the built-in screenshot command.

If you can't find an example for your specific testing framework in our [example repositories](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples), don't hesitate to contribute!
