# Playwright Quickstart

Integrate Argos with Playwright for enhanced in your CI/CD pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that:

- Your project has Playwright installed. [Installation Guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright)
- You have a CI/CD setup running your E2E tests.
- You know how to add secrets to your CI environment.

## 1. Install packages

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/playwright" />

## 2. Update Playwright config file

Enhance your Playwright configuration to capture screenshots on test failure and utilize the Argos reporter in CI environments.

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // ...

  use: {
    // Capture a screenshot when a test fails
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",

    // Retain traces when a test fails
    trace: "retain-on-failure",
  },

  // Add Argos reporter when the tests run on CI
  reporter: process.env.CI
    ? [["list"], ["@argos-ci/playwright/reporter"]]
    : "list",
});
```

## 3. Capture screenshots

Capture stabilized screenshot in your tests using the `argosScreenshot` command.

Here's an example test:

```js title="tests/homepage.spec.ts"
import { test } from "@playwright/test";
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/playwright";

test.describe("Homepage", () => {
  test("take screenshot", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("https://localhost:3000");
    await argosScreenshot(page, "homepage");
  });
});
```
