# Playwright Quickstart

Learn how to connect your Playwright project to Argos.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that:

- Playwright [is installed](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright) in your project.
- A CI/CD setup is in place to run your E2E tests.
- You know how to add a environment variables (ie. secret) to your CI.

## 1. Install packages

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/playwright" />

Read the `@argos-ci/playwright` [package doc](/playwright).

## 2. Update Playwright config file

Configure Playwright to capture screenshots on test failures and to use the Argos reporter in CI environments.

In your `playwright.config.ts`, add:

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  use: {
    // Capture a screenshot when a test fails
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",

    // Keeps traces for failed tests
    trace: "retain-on-failure",
  },

  // Adds Argos reporter in CI environments
  reporter: process.env.CI
    ? [["list"], ["@argos-ci/playwright/reporter"]]
    : "list",
});
```

## 3. Capture screenshots

In your tests, use `argosScreenshot` to capture stable screenshots and send them to Argos.

For example:

```js title="tests/homepage.spec.ts"
test("screenshot homepage", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://localhost:3000");
  await argosScreenshot(page, "homepage");
});
```

## 4. Set up your Project in Argos

Follow these steps to set up your project in Argos:

1. [Sign up](http://app.argos-ci.com/signup) on Argos.
2. Click on "Create a new project".
3. Select your Git provider and import your repository.

## 5. Setup your CI

Quickly integrate Argos with your CI setup:

- **GitHub Actions** — No extra setup required! Argos works out-of-the-box with Playwright and GitHub Actions, using a tokenless strategy for pull requests.

- **Other CI Platforms** — Simply add `ARGOS_TOKEN` to your CI environment variables.
