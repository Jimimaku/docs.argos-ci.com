# Cypress Quickstart

Learn how to connect your Cypress project to Argos.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that:

- Cypress [is installed](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) in your project.
- A CI/CD setup is in place to run your E2E tests.
- You know how to add a environment variables (ie. secret) to your CI.

## 1. Install packages

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli @argos-ci/cypress" />

Read the `@argos-ci/cypress` [package doc](/cypress).

## 2. Update Cypress config file

Copy/past this code at the end of your `cypress/support/index.js` file.

```js cypress/support/index.js
import "@argos-ci/cypress/support";
```

## 3. Capture screenshots

In your tests, use `argosScreenshot` to capture stable screenshots and send them to Argos.

For example:

```js title="cypress/e2e/homepage.cy.js"
it("screenshot homepage", async ({ page }) => {
  cy.visit("https://localhost:3000");
  cy.argosScreenshot("homepage");
});
```

#### TypeScript support

To add typings for TypeScript, update your `tsconfig.json`:

```js title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["cypress", "@argos-ci/cypress"]
  }
}
```

## 4. Set up your Project in Argos

Follow these steps to set up your project in Argos:

1. [Sign up](http://app.argos-ci.com/signup) on Argos.
2. Click on "Create a new project".
3. Select your Git provider and import your repository.

## 5. Setup your CI

Add this command to your CI pipeline to upload the screenshots to Argos.

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload cypress/screenshots
```

Then,

- **GitHub Actions** — No extra setup required! Argos works out-of-the-box with GitHub Actions, using a tokenless strategy for pull requests.

- **Other CI Platforms** — Add `ARGOS_TOKEN` to your CI environment variables.
