# Github Actions

The simplest and fastest way to send screenshot with your CI is to use the Argos tokenless feature created to **GitHub Actions**.

Add this command to your CI to safely send your screenshots to Argos.

```
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

> Replace `.\screenshots` with the folder path that contains the screenshots.
