# Use Argos with Semaphore CI

Configure [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/) to send screenshots to Argos. CI

## Configuring environment variable

<WhyArgosToken />
<GetArgosToken />

In your Semaphore project, go to Settings > Environment Variables. Then, set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable.

<TokenPrivacyWarningMessage />

If you are not comfortable with storing secret, read Semaphore CI documentation about [environment variables](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/environment-variables/).

## Configure Semaphore CI

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
blocks:
  jobs:
    # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

    - name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
      commands:
        - npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```
