# Use Argos with Semaphore CI

Configure [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform. CI

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

Read the [CLI documentation](/argos-cli#advanced-usage) if you need information about
advanced usages.

## 2. Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your repository settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. In your Semaphore CI project go to **Settings -> Environment Variables**.
3. Add a new environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` and paste the value you copied in the previous step.

If you are not comfortable with exposing environment variables, read [Semaphore CI documentation](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/environment-variables/).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
blocks:
  jobs:
    # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

    - name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
      commands:
        # ðŸ‘‡ change "./screenshots" by your screenshots folder path
        - npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
