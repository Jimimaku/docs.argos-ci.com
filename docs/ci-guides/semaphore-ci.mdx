# Use Argos with Semaphore CI

Configure [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform. CI

## 1. Install `@argos-ci/cli`

<InstallCliCommand />

## 2. Set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as CI secret

<WhyArgosToken />

- **Step 1: Get the token value**<br/>
  On Argos, go to the repository you want to set and click on the "settings" tab. Store the ARGOS_TOKEN value.

- **Step 2: Create a secret in your CI**<br/>
  In your Semaphore project, go to **Settings > Environment Variables**. Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable and paste the value you stored in the previous step.

> If you are not comfortable with storing secret, read Semaphore CI documentation about [environment variables](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/environment-variables/).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```
