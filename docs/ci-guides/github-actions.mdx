# Use Argos with GitHub Actions

Configure [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

Read the [CLI documentation](/argos-cli#advanced-usage) if you need information about
advanced usages.

## 2. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

#### Complete example

```yml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
name: Argos

on:
  push:
    # Argos has to run on your reference branch to creates reference builds
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  argos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: current

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

## Troubleshooting

### Force repository detection with `ARGOS_TOKEN`

<small>
  To ensure seamless integration with GitHub Actions, the <Tag>ARGOS_TOKEN</Tag> is
  usually not required. However, if the automatic repository detection doesn't
  work, you may need to specify the token. If that's the case, follow these
  steps:

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your project settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. On GitHub, navigate to your repository settings and set a new repository secret called `ARGOS_TOKEN` with the value you have copied.
3. Expose the `ARGOS_TOKEN` when you call the argos' upload command.

```yml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
- name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
  continue-on-error: true
  env:
    ARGOS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ARGOS_TOKEN }}
  run: npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```
