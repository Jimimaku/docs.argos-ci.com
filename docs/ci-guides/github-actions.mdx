# Use Argos with GitHub Actions

Configure [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to send screenshots to Argos.

## Set up repository token

The repository is automatically detected when you use Github Actions as CI. Therefore, you don't need to add `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable.

## Configure GitHub Actions

```yml
name: CI
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

      - name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
        run: npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

Read the [GitHub Actions repository](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/tree/main/examples/github-actions) for a complete configuration example.
