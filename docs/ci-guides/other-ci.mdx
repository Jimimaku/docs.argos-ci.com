# Use Argos with Other CI

Configure your CI to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

## 2. Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your repository settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. Expose an environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` with the value you copied in the previous step.

Depending the CI you use, you may have to set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as a secret in the settings.

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

<Enjoy />
