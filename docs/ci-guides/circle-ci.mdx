# Use Argos with CircleCI

Configure [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

Read the [CLI documentation](/argos-cli#advanced-usage) if you need information about
advanced usages.

## 2. Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your project settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. In CircleCI go to **Project settings -> Environment Variables**.
3. Add a new environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` and paste the value you copied in the previous step.

If you are not comfortable with exposing environment variables, read [CircleCI documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/env-vars/).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="argos upload ./screenshots" />

#### Complete example

```yml title=".circleci/config.yml"
jobs:
  build:
    executor: node/default
    steps:
      - checkout

      # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

      - run:
          name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
          # ðŸ‘‡ change "./screenshots" by your screenshots folder path
          command: npm exec argos upload ./screenshots

workflows:
  ci:
    jobs:
      - build
```

<Enjoy />
