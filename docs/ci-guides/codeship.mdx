# Use Argos with CodeShip

Configure [CodeShip](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/CodeShip) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install `@argos-ci/cli`

<InstallCliCommand />

## 2. Set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as CI secret

<TokenStep />

### Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

In your CodeShip project go to **Settings -> Environment Variables**. Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable and paste the value you stored in the previous step.

> If you are not comfortable with storing secret, read [CodeShip documentation about environment variables](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-codeship/latest/pro-builds-and-configuration/environment-variables).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

#### Example

```yml title="codeship-steps.yml"
- name: ci
  type: parallel
  steps:
    - service: project_name
      command: npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```
