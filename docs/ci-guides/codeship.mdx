# Use Argos with CodeShip

Configure [CodeShip](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/CodeShip) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install

<InstallCliCommand />

## 2. Set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as CI secret

- **Step 1: Get the token value**<br/>
  On Argos, go to the repository you want to set and click on the "settings" tab. Store the ARGOS_TOKEN value.

- **Step 2: Create a secret in your CI**<br/>
  In your CodeShip project go to Settings > Environment Variables. Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable and paste the value you stored in the previous step.

> If you are not comfortable with storing secret, read [CodeShip documentation about environment variables](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-codeship/latest/pro-builds-and-configuration/environment-variables).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

#### Example

```yml title="codeship-steps.yml"
- name: ci
  type: parallel
  steps:
    - service: project_name
      command: npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```
