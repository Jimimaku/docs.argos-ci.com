# Use Argos with CodeShip

Configure [CodeShip](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/CodeShip) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

## 2. Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your repository settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. In your CodeShip project go to **Settings -> Environment Variables**.
3. Add a new environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` and paste the value you copied in the previous step.

If you are not comfortable with exposing environment variables, read [CodeShip documentation](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-codeship/latest/pro-builds-and-configuration/environment-variables).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

#### Example

```yml title="codeship-steps.yml"
- name: ci
  type: parallel
  steps:
    - service: project_name
      # ðŸ‘‡ change "./screenshots" by your screenshots folder path
      command: npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

<Enjoy />
