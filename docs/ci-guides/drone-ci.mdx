# Use Argos with Drone CI

Configure [Drone CI](https://www.drone.io/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

## 2. Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your repository settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. In your DroneCI repository go to **Secrets**.
3. Add a new secret called `argos_token` and paste the value you copied in the previous step.
4. Source the environment variable from the named secret.

```
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: alpine
  environment:
    ARGOS_TOKEN:
      from_secret: argos_token
```

If you are not comfortable with exposing environment variables, read [Drone CI documentation](https://docs.drone.io/secret/repository/).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

#### Example

```yml title=".drone.yml"
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: default

steps:
  # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

  - name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
    commands:
      - npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
    secrets: [ARGOS_TOKEN]
```
