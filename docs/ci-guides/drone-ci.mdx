# Use Argos with Drone CI

Configure [Drone CI](https://www.drone.io/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install

<InstallCliCommand />

## 2. Set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as CI secret

<WhyArgosToken />

- **Step 1: Get the token value**<br/>
  On Argos, go to the repository you want to set and click on the "settings" tab. Store the ARGOS_TOKEN value.

- **Step 2: Create a secret in your CI**<br/>
  Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable and paste the value you stored in the previous step.

If you are not comfortable with storing secret, read [Drone CI documentation about repository secret](https://docs.drone.io/secret/repository/).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

#### Example

```yml title=".drone.yml"
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: default

steps:
  # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

  - name: Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
    commands:
      - npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
    secrets: [ARGOS_TOKEN]
