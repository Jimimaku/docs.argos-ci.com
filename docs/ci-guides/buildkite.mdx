# Use Argos with Buildkite

Configure [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install `@argos-ci/cli`

<InstallCliCommand />

## 2. Set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as CI secret

### Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

In your Buildkite pipeline, go to **Settings -> Steps -> Environment Variables**. Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable and paste the value you stored in the previous step.

> If you are not comfortable with storing secrets, read the [Buildkite documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/secrets#using-a-secrets-storage-service).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```
