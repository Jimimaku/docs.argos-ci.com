# Use Argos with Buildkite

Configure [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

Read the [CLI documentation](/argos-cli#advanced-usage) if you need information about
advanced usages.

## 2. Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your project settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. In your Buildkite pipeline, go to **Settings -> Steps -> Environment Variables**.
3. Add a new environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` and paste the value you copied in the previous step.

If you are not comfortable with exposing environment variables, read the [Buildkite documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/secrets#using-a-secrets-storage-service).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="argos upload ./screenshots" />

#### Complete example

```yml title="pipeline.yml"
steps:
  # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

  - label: "Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com"
    # ðŸ‘‡ change "./screenshots" by your screenshots folder path
    command: npm exec upload ./screenshots
```

<Enjoy />
