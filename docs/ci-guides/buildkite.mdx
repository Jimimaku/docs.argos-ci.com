# Use Argos with Buildkite

Configure [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install

<InstallCliCommand />

## 2. Set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as CI secret

<WhyArgosToken />

- **Step 1: Get the token value**<br/>
  On Argos, go to the repository you want to set and click on the "settings" tab. Store the ARGOS_TOKEN value.

- **Step 2: Create a secret in your CI**<br/>
  In your Buildkite pipeline, go to **Settings -> Steps -> Environment Variables**. Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable and paste the value you stored in the previous step.

> If you are not comfortable with storing secrets, read the [Buildkite documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/secrets#using-a-secrets-storage-service).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

#### Example

```yml title="pipeline.yml"
steps:
  # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

  - label: "Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com"
