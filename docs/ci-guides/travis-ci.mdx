# Use Argos with Travis CI

Configure [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install Argos CLI

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli" />

## 2. Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

1. Log in to [Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com), navigate to your repository settings and copy your `ARGOS_TOKEN`.
2. In your Travis repository, go to **Settings -> Environment Variables**.
3. Add a new environment variable called `ARGOS_TOKEN` and paste the value you copied in the previous step.

If you are not comfortable with exposing environment variables, read [Travis CI documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

<RunPkgCommand command="@argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots" />

#### Example

```yml title=".travis.yml"
script:
  # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

  # Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
  # ðŸ‘‡ change "./screenshots" by your screenshots folder path
  - npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

<Enjoy />
