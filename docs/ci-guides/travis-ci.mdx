# Use Argos with Travis CI

Configure [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) to send screenshots to Argos visual testing platform.

## 1. Install `@argos-ci/cli`

<InstallCliCommand />

## 2. Set `ARGOS_TOKEN` as CI secret

<TokenStep />

### Expose `ARGOS_TOKEN` as environment variable

In your Travis repository, go to **Settings -> Environment Variables**. Set the `ARGOS_TOKEN` as an environment variable and paste the value you stored in the previous step.

> If you are not comfortable with storing secret, read Gitlab CI documentation about [environment variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings).

## 3. Upload the screenshots

Add the following command to your CI workflow to upload screenshots to Argos:

```sh
npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```

#### Example

```yml title=".travis.yml"
script:
  # ðŸ‘‰ Insert the steps required to take screenshots

  # Upload screenshots to argos-ci.com
  - npx @argos-ci/cli upload ./screenshots
```
